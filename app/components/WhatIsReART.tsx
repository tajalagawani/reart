          ReART is a global art & real estate technology platform that bridges fine art, real estate, and immersive technology. Through merging property viewings and art exhibitions, we allow our global members to participate in-person, or through our augmented reality (AR) lenses. ReART creates new revenue streams and cross-industry collaborations between museums, galleries, artists, real estate developers, interior designers, and art collectors.
